# 3D Rendering Guide

This guide explains how to implement 3D rendering concepts, focusing on the Cube shape.

## 3D Concepts

### 3D Coordinate System

- **X-axis**: Horizontal (left to right)
- **Y-axis**: Vertical (top to bottom in 2D screens, but often bottom to top in 3D)
- **Z-axis**: Depth (towards or away from viewer)

### Rotation Angles

- **Roll (Z-rotation)**: Rotation around the front-to-back axis
- **Pitch (X-rotation)**: Rotation around the side-to-side axis
- **Yaw (Y-rotation)**: Rotation around the vertical axis

## Projection Methods

Converting 3D coordinates to 2D screen coordinates.

### Perspective Projection

Objects appear smaller as they get farther away:

- Scale factor = viewing distance / (viewing distance + z)
- x' = x * scale factor
- y' = y * scale factor

### Isometric Projection

No perspective distortion, maintains parallel lines:

- x' = (x - z) * cos(30°)
- y' = (x + z) * sin(30°) - y

## Implementing the Cube

### Key Components

1. **Vertices**: 8 corner points
2. **Edges**: 12 connections between vertices
3. **Faces**: 6 square surfaces

### Basic Approach

1. Define the 8 corner points of the cube
2. Apply rotations to all points
3. Project the 3D points to 2D
4. Draw the 12 edges connecting appropriate vertices

### Rotation Process

For each point (x, y, z), apply rotations in this order:

1. **X-rotation**:
   - y' = y * cos(angle) - z * sin(angle)
   - z' = y * sin(angle) + z * cos(angle)

2. **Y-rotation**:
   - x' = x * cos(angle) + z * sin(angle)
   - z' = -x * sin(angle) + z * cos(angle)

3. **Z-rotation**:
   - x' = x * cos(angle) - y * sin(angle)
   - y' = x * sin(angle) + y * cos(angle)

## Hidden Face Removal

For more realistic rendering, we need to identify which faces are visible.

### Backface Culling

1. Calculate the normal vector for each face
2. Determine if the face is facing toward or away from the viewer
3. Only draw faces facing the viewer

### Algorithm

For a face with vertices p1, p2, p3:

1. Calculate two vectors in the face plane: v1 = p2 - p1 and v2 = p3 - p1
2. Calculate the normal vector using cross product: N = v1 × v2
3. Take the dot product of this normal with the view vector
4. If the dot product is negative, the face is visible

## Filled 3D Rendering

To create a solid-looking cube:

1. Determine visible faces
2. For each visible face:
   - Project the 4 vertices to 2D
   - Fill the resulting quadrilateral
   - Consider adding shading based on face orientation

### Simple Shading

Vary the color intensity based on the angle between the face normal and light direction:

- Intensity = dot(face_normal, light_direction)
- Adjusted color = base_color * intensity

## Animation and Interaction

### Animation

To create a rotating cube:

1. Increment rotation angles slightly between frames
2. Redraw the cube with the new orientation
3. Maintain a consistent frame rate

### Interaction

Allow the user to control the cube:

- Arrow keys to rotate around different axes
- Mouse drag to rotate freely
- Scroll to zoom in/out

## Advanced Techniques

### Z-buffering

For multiple 3D objects or complex shapes:

1. Maintain a depth buffer (z-buffer) with the same dimensions as the image
2. For each pixel, record the z-value of the nearest object
3. Only draw a pixel if its z-value is less than the current value in the buffer

### Texture Mapping

Add surface details to the cube faces:

1. Define texture coordinates for each vertex
2. During rendering, interpolate the texture coordinates
3. Sample color from a texture image

### Lighting Models

Implement more sophisticated lighting:

1. **Ambient**: Base level of light
2. **Diffuse**: Light scattered from surfaces
3. **Specular**: Shiny highlights
